# Simon Says Game with face and emotion recognition!
A very, very, very simple game using [OpenCV](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [MS Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/) (you will need an account, free, to use the game). The game will randomly pick an emotion each turn and the user(s) need to express that emotion (yup, funny faces) to get a high score!

I'm in a hurry, the game is still full of bugs, so check directly the IPython notebook for details:  
[Simon Says Emotions Game!](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/Simon-Says-Game---Emotions-API/blob/master/Simon%20Says%20Emotions%20Game.ipynb)  
  
## If you don't have [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed, just execute: 
```
python simon_says_game.py  
```
I've added the source code from my repositories:  
  - [Using IPython and a webcam to use the Emotion Analysis from MS Cognitive services](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/MSCogServ-Emotion-Webcam)
  - [Converting from Matplotlib figures to OpenCV](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/matplotlib2opencv)
  - [Converting from OpenCV to the format necessary to send the image through HTTP to MS Cognitive Services](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/Webcam2HTTP)

I started thinking about this game after reading this:  
[Raspberry PI robot that reads your emotions](http://hackaday.com/2016/11/17/raspberry-pi-robot-that-reads-your-emotions/)  
  
And now I'm in HaD too!
